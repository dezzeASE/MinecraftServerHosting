				<h3>What I did for the CPD hours</h3>

					<p>
             First Activies which i have done is gone to the mentor sessions which was up to 5 hours.
             The proof I would have behind this would be in the register where we have signed in from.
					</p>

          <p>
            I have been also been going to gym which includes 5 hours of my CPD. I goto Castle Gym 4 Castle Blvd, New Lenton, Nottingham NG7 1FB.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the reading week I went to the networking drop in session. Which counted towards the CPD; however,
            I was unable to sign in as there were to many people and it took to long for the register to come around.
          </P>

          <p>
            I have also been playing sports which includes up to 5 hours in the CPD hour.
            I play football every friday nights with friends and play football against other people. This is at the wildcats arena.
